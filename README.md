# ozfortress match thread templater
_create match threads with magical powers_

Full disclosure: this is made for internal ozfortress use and therefore is very spagetticode and is also hardcoded in lots of places. I made this in like an hour.

## Prerequsites
+ You must have [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed

## Instructions
1. [Download](https://github.com/AndKenneth/ozf_templater/archive/master.zip) or clone this repository to your local computer.
2. Edit replace_rules.json with the details of the current round you are generating. Be sure to follow the exact format or else you will have a bad time.
3. edit the sc16.txt file if you need things tweaked for your particular round that are not defined in the included json file.
4.  run the templater.py file. You may have to set your file association to use python instead of a text editor. This will generate a file called threads.txt with copypastable threads that you can put right into the forums. Match thread titles are also included in the same file.

## Support
I'm assuming anyone using this is an ozfortress admin, so just contact me. If you're not, don't bother using this. If you're some poor compsci student looking for code examples, you're most definitely in the wrong place.
